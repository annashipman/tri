Notes and to dos:

- Need to install tree on the box
- bad form to declare type (though you can do)
- concatenates all files to make a package so can have multiple inits across files, the lib is the package to be imported
- need to figure out how to add and use the linter
- the resource to use is: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html
